This is a list of "realworld" notes that have been encountered... so people
can look at "cool new feature" and find what's known/been done before.

1. "Let's seal it and use inductive charging!"
  a)The Qi chargers are larger than the PETling so they have to be bent.
		some Qi chargers get very unhappy about that (overheating/fire),
		while others work but are *very* picky about placement on the Qi
		charging pad.
    There are inductive chargers that fit inside the cap (eg: 
    https://amzn.to/3wslaLO , but they haven't been tried yet).

  b)The seal for the PETling is at the top/inside; yeast and bacteria 
    will get in the "threaded area" and will be impossible to wash out.
    Right now, it's recommended to take the cap off and clean/sanitize
    the cap and the PETling separately.

2. Doesn't krausen/CO2 affect the readings?
  It certainly does with the commercial version; if you think it's
  settled, rock/stir your wort and see what happens.
  
3. Can the iSpindel be used in a pressurized fermenter?
  You can try... the default PETling seal is "on the inside" so that it
  makes a better seal as the pressure inside increases (sodas are 
  carbonated), which is the wrong direction, but the screw theads do make
  a seal, so...
  
4. Why use WiFi instead of BLE?
